## About the project
This was the final project for an FSD bootcamp at GeeksHubs Academy. The project consisted in designing and making a full webapp from scratch, back and front. This is the back of the project. I decided to make an app for teachers to create groups, students and tasks and easily mark the tasks and get the correctly weighted final marks for each student.

## Goal
The project required us to make a database and a REST API

The API had to include the crud of at least 2 of the entities in the diagram. I opted to full crud of all of them since it made sense for the project.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo: ` $ git clone https://github.com/Eryhnar/ScholarTrack.git`
2. ` $ npm install `
3. Create a mondodb database. I recommend using docker for this step.
4. Set the .env file and adjust the params for the database.
5. Connect to the database. If the .env is set properly, executing the following command within the ide console will connect to the database ``` $ npm run dev ```
6. Import the routes from the thunder routes collection folder.
